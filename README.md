# JaCaMo Template

A template repository for creating new JaCaMo-based applications.

## What?

Exactly what the title says,
this is a template repository to create hassle-free JaCaMo applications without starting from scratch.
You can adjust the "config.jcm" file as you wish to add or remove all the configuration that you need,
but please **don't** touch the "asl-path", "java-path" and "org-path" properties.

## How to run it?

You can use Gradle to run it,
either using the Gradle wrapper in the repository or using the Gradle tool installed on your system.
You don't even need to specify the task name; the default one will launch your application.
But if you really need to know it, for example, for running it after pressing the "play" button on your preferred IDE,
add the **run** task to your configurations and see the magic happen!
